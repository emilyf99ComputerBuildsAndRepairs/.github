## Introduction
One of the first ways I "Got Into Computers" was through fixing Video Game Consoles as a Pre-Teen".
Occasionally I return back to this skill when needed. 
While my portfolio is empty of projects I used some of these projects to show some of the technically minded work I can do. 

Occasionally I add projects here that I found interesting to undertake or took a longer time than usual to complete. However, it is not an extensive list.
This is because I do not document new builds and basic upgrades, this is to avoid project repetition and having multiple projects on the same idea.
